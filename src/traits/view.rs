/// A trait for types that can be treated as SQL views.
///
/// A view is a relation whose rows come from a query rather than from storage,
/// so unlike a table it carries no columns of its own: the names and types it
/// exposes follow from its definition. That is the whole of what this trait
/// answers, a name and a definition, plus the optional column list a
/// `CREATE VIEW` may write to rename what the definition produces.
///
/// Two kinds implement it. A plain view runs its definition on every read. A
/// materialized view holds a stored snapshot, so its rows are not the current
/// rows of the relations underneath, which is why
/// [`DQLLike::projection_source_table`](crate::traits::DQLLike::projection_source_table)
/// refuses to answer through one while
/// [`ColumnScope::resolve_column`](crate::structs::ColumnScope::resolve_column)
/// still does: a column's declared type is inherited and cannot go stale, but a
/// snapshot's rows can.
