//! The set of object kinds a [`GenericDB`] holds.
//!
//! [`GenericDB`] is generic over every kind of thing a schema contains, and
//! naming those one type parameter each made the container's parameter list
//! grow by one for every kind added, repeated at every impl block. A profile
//! carries them as associated types instead, so the container takes a single
//! parameter and a new kind costs one associated type and one field.
