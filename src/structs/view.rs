//! The two kinds of view a schema can hold.
//!
//! A plain view and a materialized view are near twins in what they expose, a
//! name and a definition query, and differ in four ways that matter: only the
//! plain one can be replaced, the two drop spellings refuse each other, nothing
//! can be written to a materialized one, and its rows are a stored snapshot
//! rather than the live rows of the relations underneath. Keeping them as two
//! types puts those differences in the type system rather than in a flag every
//! reader has to remember to check.
