//! What reading a resolved collation's name costs.
//!
//! A consumer resolves a column's comparison rule once and then asks the name
//! whenever it decides whether a comparison is reproducible, so the accessor
//! sits on the deciding path rather than beside it. An owned collation holds
//! both of its parts as `Cow::Owned`, so an accessor handing the name back by
//! value copies the identifier and the qualifier on every read. These tests
//! count allocations instead of asserting a signature, since the cost is the
//! reason the accessor lends.
