//! What the built-in PostgreSQL catalog costs a parse.
//!
//! Every constructor that takes no explicit catalog starts from
//! `PostgresCatalog::postgres_18()`, whatever the dialect, so building it sits
//! on the path of every parse. These tests count allocations, since the cost of
//! that construction is the property they pin.
